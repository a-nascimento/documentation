# openstack vagrant documentation
Download CentOS 7 install (for speed I chose a minimal mirror) - https://www.centos.org/download/
Spin up test VMs - 4 GB RAM, 2 cpu
Partition drives as needed

Follow latest rdo project install guidelines - (DO NOT USE PACKSTACK INSTALL METHOD - USE TRIPLEO Install method)

RDOProject quickstart failed so trying the following: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-docs/environments/environments.html

Need to have multiple VMS and configure a NAT Network between them with VBox
  VBoxManage natnetwork add --netname natnet1 --network "192.168.15.0/24" --enable --dhcp on
Copy SSH keys between the two hosts (deployment and openstack1)
  ssh-keygen ; ssh-copy-id root@<node>.andrew
  systemctl disable NetworkManager firewalld ; systemctl stop NetworkManager firewalld ; systemctl enable network ; systemctl start network
